# the raison d'Ãªtre of this class is that we're not necessarily sure how we're
# going to be getting export data out of a given record, or what objects and
# method names we're being given.
#
# this helps us take the various pieces of information that have and ferret
# through them to export a correctly-parsed hash of schema records to
# store in Mongo
