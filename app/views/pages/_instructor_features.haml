    %h2 Unlocks and Gating
    %p It's rare that you can start a game with final boss battle - and the same is true for learning: we often want learners to acquire foundational knowledge or skills before they're able to move on to more complicated challenges. Unlocks allow you determine what items must be done before moving on, including customizing achievement thresholds, date-completed-by, and having read feedback.
