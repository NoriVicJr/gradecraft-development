# Introduction to Gradecraft Terminology

## Terms in Gradecraft

### Course, Role, Team, Group, Badges

  * Top level grouping in Gradecraft is the Course level
  * Users have different Roles: Student, GSI (Graduate Student Instructor), Instructor
  * Roles are assigned on the course level, so for instance a Users can be a Student in one course, and a GSI for another course
  * Students can be assigned to teams, which will last for the length of a semester
  * Teams can have team leaders (usually the GSIs who are leading that team)
  * Groups are small, ad hoc, can be created by students, approved by GSIs or instructors
  * Badges can be manually awarded or attached to rubrics for automatic achievement
  * Badges can have points assigned to them
  * Badges, Teams, Groups, and Students, can be relabeled (ex. "achievements",  "players")
  * Courses cannot be re-labeled

## Grades

### Grade submission

  * All grades and assignments have to be submitted to GradeCraft.
  * Some professors use GradeCraft for all grading, but house assignment files etc. in other location (Sakai, Canvas, Moodle)
  * Grades are imported into GradeCraft through a CSV import
  * Student grades come from multiple directions

### Rubrics for Grading

  * Rubrics are a way of grading students by point value.
  * A Rubric is created on a per-assignment level
  * Rubrics break an assignment into grading categories, and a point spread is created for each category

see [Rubrics](rubrics.md) for more information.

### Assignment Types

  * Assignment types were created so that all assignments in that type will be graded similarly

see [Assignments](assignments.md) for more information.

### Assignments

#### Pass/Fail Assignments

Pass Fail grades have no point value. The pass/fail behavior is set on the assignment, and then reflected in the grades as they are assigned.

see [Pass Fail Assignments](pass_fail.md) for more information.

### Analytics

* We are interested in what behavior is a recipe for success
* The grade predictor is where the students can use analytics to maximize their potential in the class
* grade predictors occur in three types
    * sliders
    * checkbox
    * select list
